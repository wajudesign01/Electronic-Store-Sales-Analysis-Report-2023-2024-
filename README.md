#  Electronic Store Sales Analysis Report -2023-2024

# Overview 
- This project involves analyzing one year of sales and customer data from an electronic retail store.
The goal was to extract meaningful business insights to support data-driven decision-making.
The analysis covers  key areas such as sales performance, customer demographics, product preferences,
shipping behavior, and loyalty program participation.

# Aim
- Despite steady growth in orders, revenue, and customer base, the business is facing several hidden challenges.
I aim to help the business solve the challenge of how they can we optimize customer retention, 
boost loyalty program adoption, and prevent revenue decline in peak shopping periods?

# Identified Problem After Analysis:
- A sharp decline in revenue during the last quarter, especially in September (–58%).
- A low adoption rate of the loyalty program, with over 85% of customers remaining non-members.
- A significant number of orders not reaching completion (only 67.16% are completed).
- Missed opportunities in upselling/cross-selling, despite a high demand for smartphones.
- Strong customer acquisition but limited customer retention strategies

# Recommendations 

### A sharp decline in revenue during the last quarter, especially in September (–58%)
- The sharp decline in revenue during the last quarter, particularly in September,
suggests that we may not be capitalizing on seasonal demand as effectively as we could.
To counter this, we should start planning and launching marketing campaigns earlier in Q3,
including targeted discounts, and early holiday deals

### A low adoption rate of the loyalty program, with over 85% of customers remaining non-members
- With over 85% of customers not enrolled, it's clear that the value of the program isn’t being communicated well,
 or that the sign-up process may be too complex. We should consider simplifying registration .
For example, adding a one-click option at checkout & actively promoting benefits like exclusive discounts,
 early access to sales, or points rewards. Making the program more visible and rewarding will help turn first-time buyers into repeat customers

### A significant number of orders not reaching completion (only 67.16% are completed)
- many customers are dropping off before finalizing their purchase. This could be due to long or complicated checkout steps,
unexpected costs, or even technical issues. To improve this, we should streamline the checkout process and consider
implementing automated cart abandonment emails that offer reminders. Ensuring the site runs smoothly on both desktop
 and mobile will also help more customers complete their transactions.

### Missed opportunities in upselling/cross-selling, despite a high demand for smartphones
- We're also missing cross-selling opportunities, particularly with accessories like headphones
and smartwatches. Since smartphones are driving most of the sales, we can use that to our advantage by 
promoting product bundles or recommending related items during the browsing and checkout process.
This not only boosts average order value but also introduces customers to more of our catalog

###  Strong customer acquisition but limited customer retention strategies
- A large number of new buyers aren’t coming back, which limits our growth potential. 
To address this, we should create a more structured post-purchase experience;
such as sending follow-up emails with product recommendations, or exclusive offers.
Engaging customers beyond the first sale can help build brand loyalty and drive long-term revenue.

# Conclusion:
This analysis of the electronic store’s sales and customer data has revealed both growth trends and key operational challenges.
While we’ve seen positive signs in customer acquisition, revenue, and order volumes,
the business is currently under-leveraging several high-impact opportunities particularly in customer retention, loyalty engagement, and sales optimization during critical periods.
To move forward effectively, the store should adopt a more proactive approach to seasonal planning, simplify the customer journey,
and invest in nurturing long-term relationships through loyalty programs and personalized post-purchase engagement.
Little strategic improvements can lead to significant gains in revenue stability and customer lifetime value. 
By addressing these core issues with focused action, the store will be well positioned to sustain growth, enhance customer satisfaction, and build a stronger E-commerce .
