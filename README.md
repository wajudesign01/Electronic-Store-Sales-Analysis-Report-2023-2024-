#  Electronic Store Sales Analysis Report -2023-2024

# Overview 
- This project involves analyzing one year of sales and customer data from an electronic retail store.
The goal was to extract meaningful business insights to support data-driven decision-making.
The analysis covers  key areas such as sales performance, customer demographics, product preferences,
shipping behavior, and loyalty program participation.

# Aim
- Despite steady growth in orders, revenue, and customer base, the business is facing several hidden challenges.
I aim to help the business solve the challenge of how they can we optimize customer retention, 
boost loyalty program adoption, and prevent revenue decline in peak shopping periods?

# Identified Problem After Analysis:
- A sharp decline in revenue during the last quarter, especially in September (–58%).
- A low adoption rate of the loyalty program, with over 85% of customers remaining non-members.
- A significant number of orders not reaching completion (only 67.16% are completed).
- Missed opportunities in upselling/cross-selling, despite a high demand for smartphones.
- Strong customer acquisition but limited customer retention strategies

# Recommendations 

### A sharp decline in revenue during the last quarter, especially in September (–58%)
- The sharp decline in revenue during the last quarter, particularly in September,
suggests that we may not be capitalizing on seasonal demand as effectively as we could.
To counter this, we should start planning and launching marketing campaigns earlier in Q3,
including targeted discounts, and early holiday deals

### A low adoption rate of the loyalty program, with over 85% of customers remaining non-members
- With over 85% of customers not enrolled, it's clear that the value of the program isn’t being communicated well,
 or that the sign-up process may be too complex. We should consider simplifying registration .
For example, adding a one-click option at checkout & actively promoting benefits like exclusive discounts,
 early access to sales, or points rewards. Making the program more visible and rewarding will help turn first-time buyers into repeat customers

### A significant number of orders not reaching completion (only 67.16% are completed)
